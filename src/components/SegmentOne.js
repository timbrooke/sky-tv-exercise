            Last night a man rang the doorbell of Jane Alsop, screaming that
            they had caught Spring-Heeled Jack, and that they needed help. When
            she brought the man a candle there in the dark street, he proceeded
            to breathe blue flame in her face and tear at her clothes and skin
            with metal claws. She ran back towards her house, but he continued
            to cut her with his claws, until Alsopâ€™s sister came to her rescue,
            scaring off the attacker. Alsop described Jack as having eyes like
            red fireballs, and wearing a helmet and tight-fitting white outfit.
